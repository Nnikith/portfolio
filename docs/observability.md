# Observability

This is a portfolio site; observability is intentionally lightweight.

## Local logs

- Dev server logs: `/tmp/next-dev.log`
- Build / lint logs: printed to the terminal (or CI output)

## Error reporting (future)

If you later add production error reporting, prefer:

- Next.js built-in error boundaries
- A hosted tool (e.g., Sentry) only if needed

Document any additional tooling here when added.
